# online-bookstore
Online bookstore application using Spring Boot. This project will allow users to browse, search, and purchase books. It will also demonstrate your ability to handle different databases for various purposes, implement caching, and write unit tests.

Features:

User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security. Users should be able to sign up, log in, and access their account.

Book Catalog: Develop a catalog of books with features like browsing by category, searching by title or author, and viewing book details.

Checkout Process: Allow users to proceed to checkout, enter shipping details, and complete their purchase.

Multiple Databases:

Main Database (MySQL or MongoDB): Store user information, book details, and order history.
Cache (Redis): Utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed data, such as book details or user sessions, to improve performance.
Unit Testing (JUnit): Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of your codebase. Test various components including controllers, services, and repositories.

Scalability: Design your application with scalability in mind. Consider implementing features like load balancing and database sharding to handle increasing traffic and data volume efficiently.

RESTful API: Expose RESTful APIs for various functionalities like fetching book details, managing user cart, and processing orders. This will make your application flexible and easily integrable with other systems.

Frontend (Optional): You can create a simple frontend using a JavaScript framework like React or Angular to interact with your backend APIs.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation for setting up the project, configuring databases, running tests, and interacting with the APIs.
